# Release 0.1.0

Released: 2025-10-22

Highlights
---------

- Initial public release of hardened-js. A small, focused toolkit for hardening JavaScript runtimes by freezing built-ins and common environment objects.
- Public APIs:
  - `hardenAllBrowser(opts?)` — convenience entry for freezing browser-like globals and common Web APIs.
  - `hardenAllNode(opts?)` — convenience entry for freezing Node globals and runtime objects.
  - `removeAllBrowser(paths?)` and `removeAllNode(paths?)` — removal helpers to neutralize or remove listed global paths when shrinking the host surface is desired.

Key behaviors and notes
----------------------

- Freezing is defensive: the library uses `freezeDeep()` which records traversal/audit failures instead of throwing on host errors.
- Hardeners are idempotent — repeated calls are no-ops.
- Some host internals are skipped or guarded to avoid destabilizing the runtime (see README notes about `skip` options for Node).

Changelog (condensed)
----------------------

- Add core freeze utilities (`freezeDeep`, `safeFreeze`) and per-target hardeners.
- Implement browser/node convenience entry points (`hardenAllBrowser`, `hardenAllNode`).
- Implement removal helpers (`removeAllBrowser`, `removeAllNode`) with a defensive remove/neutralize strategy and reporting.
- Add tests covering the removal API and VM-isolated Node tests.
- Add ESLint + TypeScript + Vitest test suite and a CI workflow that runs lint/test/build and publishes on GitHub Release.

Upgrade / Compatibility notes
---------------------------

- This is the first release. No previous API to migrate from.
- The library attempts to work safely across Node and browser-like hosts, but behavior can vary by host (some builtins may be read-only or non-configurable). Use `skip` options when running in constrained environments.
